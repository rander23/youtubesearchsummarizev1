FINDING & SUMMARIZING EDUCATIONAL YOUTUBE VIDEOS by rander

OVERVIEW: 
This project is designed to help users find educational
YouTube videos based on a keyword, extract their transcripts, and
generate concise summaries using an AI model. It leverages YouTube\'s
API for searching and retrieving video details, YouTube Transcript API
for fetching video transcripts, and the BART model for generating
summaries.

FEATURES: 
-YouTube Video Search: Fetches the top educational YouTube
videos based on a user provided keyword. 
-Video Details Retrieval: Retrieves the link and duration of the videos. 
-Transcript Extraction: Extracts the transcripts of the videos. 
-AI-Powered Summarization: Summarizes the transcripts using the BART model.

REQUIREMENTS: 
-python compiler 
-good internet connection 
-Ensure you
have the following libraries in your python code installed 
-pip install google-api-python-client 
-pip install pandas 
-pip install youtube-transcript-api 
-pip install transformers 
-pip install torch 
-pip install isodate

USAGE: 
-Run the python file or Copy paste the code to your preferred
python compiler -Input the search keyword -Wait for the results to be
displayed

Video Title: Heat Engine Video Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjgYWv1-IB0 Duration: 0:03:31 Summary:
The second law of Thermodynamics means that only a proportion of heat
input can be converted to net output by working an engine can reduce the
internal energy of the engine. Temperatures cannot flow from colder
objects to hotter objects so we have placed a Sterling engine between
the hot tea and the cold room. Some of the heat input to the engine
flows out to the room but some of it is instead converted into work
labeled W which turns the wheel.

Video Title: Science Please! : The Internal Combustion Engine Video

Summary: The engine works in four stages first a valve opens and the
Piston lowers letting a mixture of fuel and air into the combustion
chamber. The movement of the engine is transmitted to the wheels for the
driver\'s Delight.

Video Title: How a Heat Engine Works Video Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TavafgXSynY Duration: 0:03:01 Summary:
The heat engine is a machine that converts thermal energy into
mechanical energy. The idea is these Pistons move up and down they\'ve
got different timing so the more soon to you you have the smoother the
actual power transmission.

Video Title: Heat Engines, Refrigerators, &amp; Cycles: Crash Course
Engineering #11 Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZOXW5aaCZg
Duration: 0:10:44 Summary: In engineering, we say that a system has
successfully completed a cycle if it returns to its initial state at the
end of the process. The process that your fridge uses today is based on
the work of 19th century American inventors Oliver Evans and Jacob
Perkins. With the right resources, we can keep running through cycles
until we get enough of what we want.

Video Title: Heat Engine Video Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyr6vNII3Bk Duration: 0:05:15 Summary: A
heat engine is basically a device it\'s a device which exchanges heat
between two temperature reservoirs. Heat will start flowing from this to
this so the reservoir from which the heat starts to flow is also called
the heat source. This is where you are rejecting your heat so this
becomes your heat sink. From each source this heat engine absorbs some
energy in the form of heat and gives out some work output.
